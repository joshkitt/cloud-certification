# Compute
### EC2
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html

Purchase Options
- On-demand (default) - pay by the second
- Reserved - purchase at discount for 1-3 years
    - Use if you always need a server
- Spot - purchase unused capacity at discount
    - Batch processing, process can start and stop without affecting a job

User Data - you can store information for an instance to run on startup

Placement Groups
- Cluster - Can put EC2 instances close to each other to minimize latency
    - great network speed, increased risk of failure
    - can cover multiple Azs and different hardware - want to maximize resiliency
    - launch instances in a single launch request and the same instance type
        - could get an 'insufficient capacity error' otherwise
- __Spread can only have 7 running instances per AZ__
- Partitioned - cluster EC2 instances, but spread out the clusters, up to 7 partitions per AZ

Hypervisor: Nitro and XEN

Store data in 2 ways
- Instance store - ephemeral, not persistent, lose data if stopped, but not if restarted
- Elastic Block Store - persistent

Secured by a VPC security group and a keypair for logging into the server

Scaling
- Vertical scaling - scale up instance type with additional resources (downtime)
    - ex. Upgrade from T2 Nano to T2 Micro
- Horizontal scaling - add more instances to handle more demand
    - Auto Scaling Group (Load balancer)
- High Availability - run instance of the app across multiple AZs
    - Auto Scaling Group multi AZ
    - Load Balancer multi AZ

__Soft limit of 20 EC2 instances per region (AWS can  lift this limit)__

Remote Desktop Protocol - 3389

AMI - Amazon Machine Image (eg. Amazon Linux 2)
- Pre-built from Amazon
- Marketplace for AMIs from other people
- Custom built AMI
    - Can pre-install packages
        - Faster boot time
        - Don't need to use User Data to run things
- You can't copy an AMI with an associated billingProduct code that was shared with you from another account. 
Instead, to copy, launch an EC2 instance and create AMI from instance
- Defines processor, memory, and storage type
- Cannot be changed without downtime
- __Locked to region, can be copied to a different region for use__

Instance Types
- T - General purpose, burstable
- M - General purpose, medium duty 
- C - Compute
- R - RAM - Memory optimized
- I - Storage optimized
- P - Accelerated Computing
- G - GPU optimized

__ENI Attachment__
- When it's running (hot attach)
- When it's stopped (warm attach)
- When the instance is being launched (cold attach).

### ELB
Elastic Load Balancer
- Distributes traffic across multiple targets
- Route users to different locations
- Integrates with EC2, ECS, and Lambda
- Supports one or more Azs in a region
- Any load balancer has a static hostname, do not resolve underlying IP
- Put in front of an auto-scaling group
- Like an F5
- Intelligent routing
- SSL termination
- __Access Logs can be enabled to capture detailed inforamtion about requests (disabled by default)__
- Health checks - to monitor healthy nodes before routing
    - Out of service vs In service
- HTTPS listener
    - __clients can use Server Name Indication (SNI) to specify the hostname they reach__
        - __SNI not supported in Classic Load Balancer__
        - __SNI is also available for CloudFront__
- __ELBs can scale but not instantaneously – contact AWS to “warm-up” ELBs__
- Types
    - ALB - Application Load Balancer
        - HTTP Layer 7
        - HTTP / HTTPS / Websockets
        - Called by DNS name
        - Hostname, path, redirects, dynamic host port mapping for ECS
        - Good fit for Docker 
        - Performs health checks to route to healthy nodes
        - __Stickiness cookie to send traffic back to same server for HTTP (1 sec. to 7 days)__
            - Can cause imbalance across servers
        - __Doesn't see IP of client directly - passes along client info in X-Forwarded-For, etc. header__
        - Uses "Target group" for routing target
        - __Weighted Target Groups routing__
    - NLB - Network Load Balancer
        - TCP Layer 4
        - Static IP per AZ, or Elastic IP
        - Public facing - must attach Elastic IP
        - Private facing - gets random private IP
        - __Higher performance than ALB__
        - Low-latency
        - NLB does not use X-Forwarded-For header, you can see source IP
    - Classic Load Balancer
        - original AWS service
        - For older configurations
        - cheaper
        - not as intelligent
- Security groups
    - __Security groups can reference other security groups__
    - __Load balancer security group can be allowed in to the EC2 instance security group__
        - Used to provide security by limiting direct EC2 access (must go through ELB first)
-  SSL / TLS Certificates
    - __AWS Certificate Manager - used to manage certificates__
    - __Server Name Indication (SNI) - clients can specify the hostname - multiple certs for diff domains__
        - __ELB (except Classic) can use SNI, along with CloudFront__
        - Can use many certificates for different domains

### Auto Scaling Group
- Scale in or out based on CloudWatch alarms - built-in metrics and custom metrics
- Free - just pay for resources being launched
- Will terminate unhealthy instances and recreate them
- Termination policy default (scale in)
    1. Will choose the AZ with the most instances first
    2. Will terminate the oldest launch configuration first
    3. __Will terminate the instance that is closest to the next billing hour__
- Scaling cooldown
    - Can change cooldown and threshold settings to optimize the amount of scaling and minimize thrashing
    - If scaling up and down too much, modify the cooldown timer and CloudWatch alarm period that triggers the scale-in
    - __Cooldown period defaults to 300 seconds__
- Launch configuration defines instance template for the group
- Defines min, max, and desired number of instances
- Performs health checks on each instance
- Includes scaling policies that define behavior
- Exists within 1 ore more AZs within a single region
- Application Load Balancer - communicates with Auto-Scaling Group to know to route traffic to healthy nodes

### ECR
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/what-is-ecr.html

### ECS
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html

- __SSD can be used for bootable volume (HDD CAN NOT)__
- __SSD is good for small, random I/O__
- __HDD is good for large, sequential I/O__
- Types 
    - General purpose (SSD) - default, less expensive
        - __Max 16,000 IOPS (3x disk size, up to max)__
    - Provisioned IOPS (SSD) - pay more for higher level of performance - most expensive
        - __IO1 more than 16,000 IOPS (outdated - new max of 32,000)__
        - __Maximum ratio of provisioned IOPS volume size (GB) is 50:1 (ex. 500 IOPS / 10 GB)__
            - 64,000 IOPS on Nitro instances
            - 32,000 IOPS on other instances 
    - Throughput optimized HDD - chatty database use-case, cheaper
    - __Cold HDD - cheap, good for infrequently accessed, sequential__
    - Magnetic - cheapest

__Automatically replicated within the AZ (only within the AZ) to prevent data loss due to a failure__

__Support live configuration changes while in production__
    - __You can modify the volume type, volume size and IOPS capacity without service interruptions.__

Snapshots
- Point in time snapshot, gets stored in S3 behind the scenes (same durability)

- __Configure in OS__
- __To take a snapshot of a RAID array, you have to stop all volume I/O and flush all caches to disk,
then snapshot each volume__

Can not attach a drive across Azs
- Must snapshot, create volume from snapshot

Disk IO is high => increase volume size (for gp2)

# Networking and Content Delivery

### VPC

A logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define
 
- Enables virtual networks (IPv4 and IPv6)
    - IP address range, subnets, route tables, network gateways
- Supports public and private subnets
- Can utilize NAT for private subnets
- Enables a connection to your own datacenter
- Can connect to others
- VPC Endpoint - can add a private endpoint between services to keep traffic in the VPC and not over the public internet
    - Supports private connections to many AWS services (VPC endpoints)
    - Types 
        - __Gateway VPC Endpoint - for DynamoDB and S3 only__
        - Interface VPC Endpoint - for other services 
- Security Groups - (stateful) applied to services, used as a firewall
- Network Access Control Lists - (stateless) - more like a traditional firewall
    - Only associated with subnets (not services)
- Virtual Private Network (VPN)
- Elastic IPs - static IP address that won't change that can be assigned to services. Can scale (elastic).
- Internet Gateways - Elastic scalable gateway to the internet
    - Unlimited bandwidth
- NAT Gateway - allows you to remain private in a private subnet but get certain internet traffic (patch updates, etc)
    - Has a hard bandwidth limit and is limited by EC2 instance type/size used.
- Route Table - a simple route table
- Public Subnet - has an Internet Gateway routed in the Route Table
- Flow Logs - gives you logs for network
- __AWS reserves 5 IP addresses for their own use__
    - __The first 4 IPs, and the last 1 IP are reserved__
    - ex. If you need 29 IP addresses for EC2, you can't choose a Subnet of size /27 (only 32 IP)
        - You need at least Subnet size /26 for 64 IP  
- __A VPC can only have 1 Internet Gateway__
- __Egress only Internet Gateway is for IPV6 only__
- __VPC Peering can connect 2 VPCs together (not transitive)__
    - For each VPC subnet you want to peer, you have to change the route table on both sides
    - __CIDRs must not overlap__
- __If you need multicast networking, create a virtual overlay network running on the OS level__
- Enhanced Networking
    - Higher packet per second performance
    - lower inter-instance latency  

NACL
- STATELESS - traffic will be evaluated against rules on both ingress and egress
- Controls inbound and outbound traffic for subnets within the VPC
- VPCs are automatically given a default NACL with allows all outbound and inbound traffic
- Each subnet within a VPC must be associated with a NACL - either explicit or implicit
- Subnets can only be associated with 1 NACL at a time
- Rule can either ALLOW or DENY traffic (SecurityGroups can only ALLOW)
- When you create a NACL, it will deny all traffic by default (this is different than when AWS Default VPC creates NACL)

Security Group
- STATEFUL
- All traffic is not allowed by default
- There are no DENY rules, only allow rules
- Multiple EC2 instances across multiple subnets can belong to a Security Group
    - Can be attached to multiple instances
- Cannot block a specific IP Address (need NACL for that)
- firewall-like controls for resources within the VPC
- Locked down to a region/vpc combination
 
VPC Flow logs - captures the information around traffic within the VPC
